## Current status (August 2019)
It could be compiled using the compiler Free Pascal (fpc)
(https://www.freepascal.org/). This means that executable files can be generated for
different operating systems.

## Compilation attempts
2019-08-26: unsuccessful (tried with FPC compiler under Linux Debian OS, see Issues).

## A discussion was opened on August 2019 on this forum thread to attempt a compilation with help of free pascal community
https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,46538.0.html
